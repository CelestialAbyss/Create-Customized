# What is a string?

A string is never a number, but is instead indicated by the following:

| String Type | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| 'minecraft:iron_sword' | In JavaScript, single quotation marks are usually used. |
| "minecraft:iron_sword" | Double quote strings are usually used in JSON or whenever a string contains a word like `that's` or `it's` which can be commonly found in tooltips or lang files. |
| \`minecraft:iron_sword` | Backticks should **only** be used in string templates. |
