> This "wiki" is for KubeJS on 1.19.2 only. However, syntax has not changed significantly enough to the point you will have to re-write everything to make your scripts work on 1.20.x but there are still some minor differences.

Be sure to have these mods already installed beforehand. The text in blue are links that you can click on if you are not already aware of this fact.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## What is Visual Studio Code?

It is basically a specialized "Notepad" program in simplified terms.

It has the advantage of: 

- Formatting `.json` and `.js` files correctly and uniformly.
- Syntax highlighting
  - What is `syntax highlighting`? It means that it color codes text to help identify what does what.
- Highlights errors in your code with red lines with warnings underlined with yellow
- Opening your Minecraft folder instance for easy access
- Has support for `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.snbt` mod config files with extensions installed.
- Has support for viewing `.nbt` files
  - Requires NBT Viewer by Misode to be installed
