# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have never done any coding before.

You can only write code by getting into it or practicing with it along with reading and **understanding** information given in the documentation. There is no other way around this.

## Wouldn't datapacks be easier?

Datapacks require a datapack loader, and matching the same exact folder path. Not only that, but it takes longer to write multiple `.json` recipes at once compared to just writing a script in either JS or ZS.

## Will you backport your scripts to 1.16.5 or older?

***NO.*** It is time to move on from those versions as they are End of Life.

## How do I use your scripts with Create?

Follow the documentation provided in each respective branch of this GitHub repository.
