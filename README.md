Code for modifying vanilla Create recipes and material utilization.

Hi there! If you are looking to add recipes that involve Create, you have come to the right place. Click the dropdown menu on the top left corner with an icon that looks like a branch, or click on the word `branches` next to the dropdown menu.

You can then navigate to the branch that meets your specific needs with either KubeJS or CraftTweaker.

If you still have not found the branch drop down menu or the word `branches` with a number next to it, I have also arranged for a table below with links attached. Sorted by newest Minecraft version on top.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have never done any coding before.

You can only write code by getting into it or practicing with it along with reading and **understanding** information given in the documentation. There is no other way around this.

## Wouldn't datapacks be easier?

Datapacks require a datapack loader, and matching the same exact folder path. Not only that, but it takes longer to write multiple `.json` recipes at once compared to just writing a script in either JS or ZS.

## Will you backport your scripts to 1.16.5 or older?

***NO.*** It is time to move on from those versions as they are End of Life.

## How do I use your scripts with Create?

Follow the documentation provided in each respective branch of this GitHub repository.
